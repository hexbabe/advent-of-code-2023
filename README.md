# advent-of-code-2023

Dear Diary,

I was eating my lunch when I noticed my coworker at Viam, Clint, sent a volunteer posting for Software Engineer @ The North Pole. Not thinking too much of it, I signed up. Little did I know, this was the start of an adventure straight out of a mad scientist's Christmas wish list.

## Dec 1

Day 1: Trebuchet?! More like, "Tr√©-bu-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into"! The Elves, with their mysterious smiles, briefed me on a global snow production crisis. My mission? Restore snow operations by solving puzzles at fifty star-marked locations. Simple, right?

But wait, there's a twist! My mode of transport wasn't a comfy sleigh or a high-tech teleporter. Oh no, it was a medieval trebuchet! As I voiced my concerns (and my will), the Elves simply shushed me with "not powerful enough," "the sky," and "you sure ask a lot of questions." Before I could process the absurdity, I was being strapped into this ancient catapult. Talk about unconventional travel!

The Elves were ready to launch me skyward when they hit a snag. Their calibration document, essential for my safe trajectory, had been doodled on by a young Elf artiste. The document was now a mix of numbers and what looked like reindeer playing Sudoku.

Lunch break turned into a puzzle-solving session. Using my epic S.W.E. skills, I deciphered the calibration values amidst the artistic chaos. The Elves, impressed, gave me a thumbs-up (or was it a farewell gesture?).

The countdown began. Three... two... one... WHOOSH! The world spun as I flew through the air, my lunch regretting its existence. As I soared, I couldn't help but wonder, "How does one land gracefully from a trebuchet?" Spoiler alert: You don't.

Touching down (crashing, really) at the first location, I dusted off the snow from my hair and chuckled. This was going to be one wacky December. Trebuchets, puzzles, and elves - oh my!

Here's to saving Christmas, one star at a time. And maybe, just maybe, I'll suggest drones for next year's transport.
