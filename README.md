# Dear Diary,

I was eating my lunch when I noticed my coworker at Viam, Clint, sent a volunteer posting for Software Engineer @ The North Pole. Not thinking too much of it, I signed up. Little did I know, this was the start of an adventure straight out of a mad scientist's Christmas wish list.

## December 1

Trebuchet?! More like, "Tr√©-bu-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into"! The Elves, with their mysterious smiles, briefed me on a global snow production crisis. My mission? Restore snow operations by solving puzzles at fifty star-marked locations. Simple, right?

But wait, there's a twist! My mode of transport wasn't a comfy sleigh or a high-tech teleporter. Oh no, it was a medieval trebuchet! As I voiced my concerns (and my will), the Elves simply shushed me with "not powerful enough," "the sky," and "you sure ask a lot of questions." Before I could process the absurdity, I was being strapped into this ancient catapult. Talk about unconventional travel!

The Elves were ready to launch me skyward when they hit a snag. Their calibration document, essential for my safe trajectory, had been doodled on by a young Elf artiste. The document was now a mix of numbers and what looked like reindeer playing Sudoku.

Lunch break turned into a puzzle-solving session. Using my epic S.W.E. skills, I deciphered the calibration values amidst the artistic chaos. The Elves, impressed, gave me a thumbs-up (or was it a farewell gesture?).

The countdown began. Three... two... one... WHOOSH! The world spun as I flew through the air, my lunch regretting its existence. As I soared, I couldn't help but wonder, "How does one land gracefully from a trebuchet?" Spoiler alert: You don't.

Touching down (crashing, really) at the first location, I dusted off the snow from my hair and chuckled. This was going to be one wacky December. Trebuchets, puzzles, and elves - oh my!

Here's to saving Christmas, one star at a time. And maybe, just maybe, I'll suggest drones for next year's transport.

After the inaugural trebuchet tour, I landed (quite gracefully, if I may add) on Snow Island, greeted by an apologetic Elf. Snow was scarce, but games were not.

The Elf introduced me to a curious cube game. I was to deduce the number of colored cubes (red, green, blue) hidden in a bag based on samples he showed me. Each game had a unique sequence of cube reveals, making it a brainteaser of colors and numbers.

I played several games, each more perplexing than the last, and meticulously recorded the outcomes. Then came the Elf's first challenge: determine which games were possible with only 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue cubes in the bag. A puzzle tailor-made for my newfound role as a color-coded cube analyst!

After some deliberation and a fair bit of head-scratching, I calculated that games 1, 2, and 5 fit the criteria. The total sum of their IDs? A surprising 2600.

But there was more. The Elf, hinting at a snow production crisis due to a water shortage, posed a second puzzle: For each game, what was the minimum number of cubes needed to make the sequences possible?

Back to the drawing board, or rather, the cube bag, I went. This task required a mix of logic, guesswork, and a dash of SWE magic. Finally, I calculated the 'power' of each minimum cube set - the product of the minimum numbers of red, green, and blue cubes.

The powers for each game added up to a staggering 86036. It was a mental workout that left me both exhilarated and exhausted.

As the day drew to a close, the Elf guided me towards the water source, the next piece of this snowy puzzle.

What a day, Diary. From sky-high puzzles to cube conundrums, it's all in a day's work at Snow Island!

Just when I thought my adventure couldn't get more mechanically inclined, I stumbled upon the next challenge.

After our colorful cube escapade, the Elf and I reached a gondola lift station, my next stop to the water source. However, the gondolas weren't operational. Cue my introduction to a slightly-greasy Elf, clutching a wrench and a bewildered expression.

He explained that the gondola lift was down due to a missing engine part. Not one to shy away from a challenge, I offered to help. The task? Add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic to identify the missing component. A jigsaw puzzle with an engineering twist!

The schematic was a maze of numbers and symbols. Following the rule that only numbers adjacent to a symbol counted as part numbers, I delved into calculations. The sum? A whopping 533784. It felt like cracking a cryptic code. The greasy Elf was overjoyed; we had identified the missing part!

The first half of my task was complete, and I earned a gold star, quite literally.

Part Two of the gondola saga involved a slow-moving ascent. Or rather, a non-moving one. Despite the replacement of the missing part, the gondola was stubbornly stationary. I was still at the station, the engineer waving at me from outside. Talk about an anti-climactic start!

The new problem? A wrongly-sized gear in the engine. The task now was to find the gear ratios. Gears were defined as * symbols adjacent to exactly two part numbers. I had to multiply these numbers to get each gear's ratio and sum them all up.

Revisiting the engine schematic, I turned into a makeshift mathematician, calculating gear ratios. It was like playing connect-the-dots, but with a mechanical twist. The total sum? An impressive 78826761.

The engineer swapped out the faulty gear, and finally, the gondola sprang into motion. As I ascended to the water source, I couldn't help but marvel at the odd turns my journey had taken. From trebuchets to gears, this was turning out to be an engineer's holiday extravaganza.

What mechanical marvels await me next? Stay tuned, Diary. It's all gears and stars from here.
